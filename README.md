# KeyLogger-Spyware--Python
 Just like the name suggests, It's a simple spyware when executed records every keystroke typed in that particular pc and save it in log.txt file. I made it out of pure curiosity and the fact that i was bored as hell. If (for whatever reason, not gonna judge lol) you wanna test it u must turn your antivirus off as it will detect it as trojan. Well have fun LOL. ;-)
